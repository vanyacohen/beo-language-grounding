Produced by North American Aviation, the Sabre is best known as the United States' first swept wing fighter that could counter the swept-wing Soviet MiG-15 in high-speed dogfights in the skies of the Korean War (1950–1953), fighting some of the earliest jet-to-jet battles in history. Considered one of the best and most important fighter aircraft in that war, the F-86 is also rated highly in comparison with fighters of other eras.[3] Although it was developed in the late 1940s and was outdated by the end of the 1950s, the Sabre proved versatile and adaptable and continued as a front-line fighter in numerous air forces until the last active operational examples were retired by the Bolivian Air Force in 1994"

Each main rotor is mounted on a vertical mast over the top of the helicopter, as opposed to a helicopter tail rotor, which connects through a combination of drive shaft(s) and gearboxes along the tail boom. The blade pitch is typically controlled by a swashplate connected to the helicopter flight controls. Helicopters are one example of rotary-wing aircraft (rotorcraft). The name is derived from the Greek words helix, helik-, meaning spiral; and pteron meaning wing"

Airbus studies started in 1988 and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long haul market. The A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It obtained its EASA and FAA type certificates on 12 December 2006. Difficulties in electrical wiring caused a two-year delay and the development cost ballooned to €18 billion."

Designed and manufactured by Northrop, later Northrop Grumman, the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737 million (in 1997 dollars).[3] Total procurement costs averaged $929 million per aircraft, which includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support.[3] The total program cost, which included development, engineering and testing, averaged $2.1 billion per aircraft in 1997"

They are short- to medium-range, narrow-body jet airliners powered by two engines. Produced since 1996 by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the 737NG series includes four variants and can seat between 110 and 210 passengers. Formally launched in 1993, the 737NG is an upgrade of the preceding 737 Classic models featuring a redesigned wing that is larger in area, with a wider wingspan, and greater fuel capacity. It is equipped with CFM56-7 series engines, a glass cockpit, and features upgraded and redesigned interior configurations. Performance and capability upgrades over its predecessor include longer range, greater capacity (in its largest variants), and available higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) specifications."

Seating from 100 to 240 passengers and flying throughout the world – and landing on every continent – an A320 takes off or lands every 1.6 seconds. From the heat of the desert to icy Antarctic runways, or from short runway urban environments to remote high-altitude airports, the A320 can take passengers anywhere. As the longest-range single-aisle aircraft, airlines and passengers alike have benefitted from the A320’s exceptional efficiency and quality since its introduction, which has opened up exciting new travel possibilities throughout the world. Now with new engine options (NEO) available, the A320 Family continues to be the preferred choice for passengers and customers; setting the standard for the single-aisle market and securing its status as the world’s best-selling aircraft of all time. This is an aircraft that you can rely on. This is the aircraft that changed the game."

It was designed in the 1980s by the Antonov design bureau in the Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union (USSR). Until the Boeing 747-8F, the An-124 was, for thirty years, the world's heaviest gross weight production cargo airplane and second heaviest operating cargo aircraft, behind the one-off Antonov An-225 (a greatly enlarged design based on the An-124).[5] The An-124 remains the largest military transport aircraft in the world.[6] The lead designer of the An-124 (and the An-225) was Viktor Tolmachev.[7] During development it was known as Izdeliye 400 (Product #400) in house, and An-40 in the West. First flown in 1982, civil certification was issued on 30 December 1992.[8] In July 2013, 26 An-124s were in commercial service with 10 on order.[9] In August 2014, it was reported that plans to resume joint production of the Antonov An-124 had been shelved due to the ongoing political tensions between Russia and Ukraine.[10] The sole remaining production facility is Russia's Aviastar-SP in Ulianovsk. The various operators of the An-124 are in discussions with respect to the continuing airworthiness certification of the individual An-124 planes. The original designer of the An-124 is responsible for managing the certification process for its own products, but Russian/Ukrainian conflicts are making this process difficult to manage. Military operators are able to self-certify the airworthiness of their own aircraft, but Russian civil operators must find a credible outside authority for certification if Ukraine is unable to participate in the process"

The Fokker 70 allows the same type rating as the Fokker 100 enabling optimum use of flight crews at a minimum cost as well as maximum flexibility in matching seat supply with passenger demand. The Fokker 70s are active worldwide, including a number in VIP configurations. FLYFokker for economic sense. The operation of the Fokker 70 is supported by FLYFokker, our full-service Life Cycle Support program. FLYFokker comprises a package of four solutions: Take Off, Take Care, Take Over and Take Next. Start-up operators can Take Off with their operation in six weeks instead of typically six months. For mature Fokker operators Take Care is a complete solution to increase Technical Dispatch Reliability (TDR), reduce Direct Operating Cost (DOC) and improve passenger comfort. Operators moving to other aircraft types are supported by Fokker Services in the Take Over of the continued competitive operation of their Fokker fleet. The fourth solution is a package for the mean and lean transfer of aircraft to the next operator, entitled Take Next. Choosing Fokker makes economic sense. This is what existing and start-up operators are saying, refer to the various customer testimonials. Many airlines and operators fly Fokker aircraft. Fokker Services continuously invests in supporting close to 500 flying Fokker aircraft across the world for decades to come. For Continued Competitive Operation."

They are short- to medium-range, narrow-body jet airliners powered by two engines. Produced since 1996 by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the 737NG series includes four variants and can seat between 110 and 210 passengers. Formally launched in 1993, the 737NG is an upgrade of the preceding 737 Classic models featuring a redesigned wing that is larger in area, with a wider wingspan, and greater fuel capacity. It is equipped with CFM56-7 series engines, a glass cockpit, and features upgraded and redesigned interior configurations. Performance and capability upgrades over its predecessor include longer range, greater capacity (in its largest variants), and available higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) specifications."

They are short- to medium-range, narrow-body jet airliners powered by two engines. Produced since 1996 by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the 737NG series includes four variants and can seat between 110 and 210 passengers. Formally launched in 1993, the 737NG is an upgrade of the preceding 737 Classic models featuring a redesigned wing that is larger in area, with a wider wingspan, and greater fuel capacity. It is equipped with CFM56-7 series engines, a glass cockpit, and features upgraded and redesigned interior configurations. Performance and capability upgrades over its predecessor include longer range, greater capacity (in its largest variants), and available higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) specifications."
